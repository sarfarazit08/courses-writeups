# Basic Reserach Skills 


1. Introduction


1
 
 
Hi,I am Dr.Subramonian, Welcome  to  my Course. 
This course  teaches you how to decide on what you need to know when you 
need to know it. With all of the information readily available today, it's difficult 
to decipher  information. Instead using only an Internet search engine for all of 
your information, there are other sources that can help you learn what you need 
to learn – quickly and accurately. This course will cover library use, the Dewey 
Decimal System, dictionary use, thesaurus use, encyclopaedias, Internet search 
engines, Internet news resources, Internet publications, journals, and 
bibliographies.   
 
With this course, you can research in any topic, no matter the purpose or the 
goal. Instead of simply looking in one place for the answer you need, why not 
learn how to use all of the tools available? The more you know, the more you 
can use this information in your everyday life. 
This course  includes real life strategies to help you learn where you need to 
look for information and how you can be certain the information is accurate. 
With this course  you will be able to find information in a variety of ways, 
ensuring no question goes unanswered. 
The easy to learn modules in this course include,  
Introduction to the course 
Module 1 : Importance of Research 
Though the Internet is a valuable tool, it is not the only research skill a person 
needs in order to find the facts. 
Module  2:Professional use of  Library 
Though it might sound strange, many people have forgotten about using the 
library. 
Module 3: Dewey Decimal System 
Organizing reference books is difficult when there is no system. While some 
people might prefer books to be organized by authors, when you are organizing 
reference books. 
 
Module 4: Professional way of using a Dictionary 
Many people may not think about a dictionary as being a reference book, but it 
can help you begin to understand not only the words you might not know, but 
also how they can be used in a paper, project, or article. 
Module 5: Thesaurus 
Like a dictionary, a thesaurus can help you to expand the way that you discuss 
your topic. A thesaurus contains groupings of words that are collected in terms 
of their meaning. 
Module  6:Professional use of  Encyclopaedias, Almanacs, and Atlases 
Before the time of the Internet, there were other ways one could research 
specific topics. 
Module 7: Using Internet Search Engines 
The Internet is often the first place many people go when they need to do 
research. 
Module 8: Internet News Sources 
When you get online in the morning, one of the first things you might do is go 
onto a news site to find out what has happened in the world. 
Module  9: Internet Magazines, Blogs, and Images 
Research is not always about gathering facts. Sometimes you need to do 
research in order to formulate an opinion about a topic. 
Module 10: Journals, Papers, and More 
When researching academic topics, it can help to look at journals, papers, and 
other academic publications. 
Module 11: Bibliographies in Research 
When someone else has already done research on a topic, it makes sense that 
the person keeps track of what they used.

2. Importance of Research


1
 
 
Hi,I am Dr.Subramonian, Welcome  to  Professional Diploma in Research 
Studies Course Module 1 Importance of Research  
Whether you love it or hate it, you need to do it.  Finding out the facts about 
your assignments, your job, or your life will allow you to make better decisions 
and gain more knowledge.  In fact, the more research you do, the more you can 
do with your life. 
Learning basic research skills is something that is lost in many educational 
systems. While students are often told how to find information, the Internet has 
become the place most people go first in order to find the facts they need. 
Though the Internet is a valuable tool, it is not the only research skill a person 
needs in order to find the facts. Using basic research methods can help you not 
only find the information you need, but also find information that you can trust.  
 
 
Advantages of Good Research 
 Whether you need to do research for a class or for another sort of assignment, 
there are many advantages to using as many research tools as you can. 
 When you find a fact in one reference source that is supported in another 
reference source, you can be assured that the fact you are using in your business 
paper or assignment is accurate. 
The more resources you use, the more viewpoints you will consider during your 
topic exploration.  
When you use more research skills and sources, you will be able to gain more 
facts for your final project. 
Because different research sources offer different kinds of information, you can 
find different ways to understand your topic, depending on the manner in which 
you need to present your findings. 
 If you need to prepare for a presentation or a test, you want to be able to find 
the facts about your topic quickly.  With basic research skills, you will find 
what you need promptly. 
 
 
 
Applying your  Research Skills 
When you learn these basic research skills, you will begin to see that these skills 
are not just useful in a classroom.  You can also develop these skills to help you 
at: 
Work. If you need to give a presentation at work, having done some basic 
research will allow you to present your facts without worrying about their 
validity. 
Writing. Communication is something you need to do every day. The more you 
research, the more effective your writing and communication will be. 
Local organizations. If you are involved in local organizations, being able to 
research your needs ahead of time is a great way to ensure you are prepared for 
meetings, discussions, and more. 
Family matters. Within your family, you might want to learn about different 
topics that you have heard about in school or in the newspaper.  As a family, 
you can work together to find out more and to teach others the facts you have 
obtained. 
Family history. When your family is interested in its history, using research 
skills will allow you to find the information you want, even if you are not sure 
what you are looking to find. 
Interview preparation. Before a job interview, it can be helpful to learn about 
the position or about the market.  Learning how to research these topics helps 
you become the perfect job candidate. 
Board meeting preparation. If you are sitting down with top executives, you 
need to know what you are talking about and what it means in terms of your 
board meeting. The more you can prepare, the more you will be able to offer to 
others in the meeting. 
Instead of simply going to the computer to type in the questions you think you 
need to answer or using the first search result you find as the answer, it is time 
to look into what other ways you can begin to research the questions that pop 
up. 
 
 


3. Use of Library


6
Though it might sound strange, many people have forgotten about using the library. Because 
many libraries now offer their collections online, many people are forgoing the library in favor of 
heading to their computers.  While this makes sense for those who might not be in driving 
distance of a high quality library, this also means many people are forgetting how to use a 
library. 
 
When you walk into a library, there are many resources at your fingertips. You just need to know 
what to use, how to use it, and when to ask for help.  
 
  
Orient yourself.  If you have not been to a library in a while, you need to orient yourself 
again. Most libraries are arranged in a similar pattern, so this section will help you learn more 
about your local library as well. 
  New Books section: When you walk into a library, one of the first displays you might see is 
the New Books section.  This is where the latest books are on display so that visitors can find 
them easily.  Here, you might find the latest nonfiction books to support your research topic. 
  Special display cases and tables: Sometimes there will be special displays during holiday 
seasons or when an author comes out with a new book in a series.  
  Adult fiction: A large section, the adult fiction section is a place where you can find books 
arranged by the author's last name. 
  Non-fiction and reference books: If you are looking for the reference section, you will want 
to seek out nonfiction.  This area is going to be arranged by the Dewey Decimal system, which 
will be covered in the next course section. 
Module 2 
LIBRARY USE 
  Card catalogs: You might also notice there are card catalogs or computers that will allow you 
to find the books you need. These catalogs might allow you to search by title, author, or 
subject, depending on your question. 
If you have not been to the library in a few years, simply take a moment to walk around first so 
you can go to the section you need without wasting time. 
Ideally, you will go to the computers or the card catalogs to search for the books you need, write 
down their numbers or authors, and then move into the sections to find the books on the shelves. 
Different Types of Libraries to Use 
Depending on the topic you need to research, you might find that different libraries might serve 
you better. Many people do not realize it, but there is more than one type of library in most cities. 
Other libraries include: 
  Public: This library is the typical library, funded by tax dollars and working to make sure the 
local community has the books it needs without having to charge anyone to read them. 
  Academic: If you need to research something that is more complicated, heading to an 
academic library might be a wise choice. These libraries are often specifically tailored to one 
subject. For example, you might go to a medical school library when researching a health-
related topic. Other possible academic libraries include engineering, nursing, law, etc. 
  School: While universities and colleges have their own libraries, many other schools and 
grade levels do, too. Depending on the research you need to do, you might not be able to use 
these libraries because they may not have the items you need in order to successfully research 
your topic. Think about your topic and what you need to find before you head to a library for 
younger students. 
  Miscellaneous libraries: There are other libraries that are also available in your local 
surroundings, though you might need to call to see if you can use them.  For example, if you 
need to research a local company, you might be able to see their personal library for reports, 
statistics, financial records, etc. 
Think about the topic you need to cover and what this might mean in terms of where you need to 
be for your research.  In most cases, a public library will work well, but when you need to access 
cutting edge information, the universities offer a wider collection of resource materials. 
The New Computer Systems 
You may not have used the card catalog system before, so the computer systems are more 
familiar to use.  Set up to be accessible for anyone, these computers offer a wealth 
of information. 
To make sure you can find what you are looking for, here are some tips to make the computers 
help you more effectively: 
  Have titles in mind. If you are heading to the library, it never hurts to have the titles you want 
in your mind already. This will allow you to easily type in the title names and then begin to 
use the books for your personal research.  Double-check the title names before you leave for 
the library. 
  Know author names. If you do not know the titles, perhaps you know the names of authors 
and experts in the field. These will be easy to input into the computer to see what you can find. 
  Pick out keywords. When you are researching a specific subject, try to choose one to five 
keywords that come up frequently in the literature.  For example, if you research "weight 
loss," you might also type in "diet." Have this list of keywords available to find as many 
related books as possible. 
  Have a question. Before you walk into the library, have a question or two that you are trying 
to answer. This will focus your research and  allow you to make the most of your time. 
  Bring related book titles. If you already have done some research elsewhere, bring those 
titles along with you. Even if you already have those books at home, look for them in the 
library and then look to the right and the left of the book on the shelf. More often than not, 
those adjacent books will offer you additional ideas and information about your topic. 
  Use a notepad. As you walk along, make sure to bring your notepad. This will keep track of 
the numbers and letters you need to find for each book or topic you research. The more 
numbers you have, the more you will head in the proper direction when you are in the library. 
Using the library is easy and it only takes a little direction from you in order to fully realize how 
many books can help you with your topic of study.  
Ask the Librarian 
At times, you may not know where to begin with a research topic. Though you might have basic 
research skills, if you are not sure where to go or what questions to ask, it can help to bring in a 
third party who is not attached to your research: the librarian. 
Librarians are trained to help people find the books they need or the topics they are interested in.  
By talking to librarians about what you want and what you need to cover in your research, they 
may be able to point out additional resources you had not yet considered. 
When you talk with the librarian, it can help to: 
  have book titles that have been helpful to you. If you already have found helpful books, show 
the librarian so she or he can look for similar books in the stacks. 
  have a question you need to answer. Yes, it can help to have a question in mind when you talk 
to librarians. They will help you answer it. 
  introduce the problem you have. When you have a problem with your research, be clear about 
what you are being troubled by. Chances are good the librarian can point you in a better 
direction. 
The librarians are there to help you with your research. They have gone to school and received a 
master's degree in library sciences to learn how to use the reference materials and how to ensure 
that you find the answers you need.  
Talking to Other Libraries 
One of the best innovations of the library system is that you can now communicate with other 
libraries in the same way that librarians can.  If you go to a computer terminal and you find a 
book you want, but it is not at that library, you can have the book sent to your home library. 
Or you can have that book put on hold for you and then go to the other library to retrieve it.  You 
are no longer limited to the shelves that you have in your community library. 
 
Remember, you can: 
  request to put an item on hold; 
  request that a book be transferred to your library; 
  renew a book you already have out; 
  find out how long it might be until a book comes back into circulation. 
The library system is designed to help you get the book you want as quickly as possible. You can 
take control of the process by telling the computer what you want it to do with the books you 
need. 
Thank you. 

4. Dewey Decimal System


10
Module 3 
DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM 
Organizing reference books is difficult without a system. Some people might prefer that books 
always be organized by authors, but that is not practical when you are organizing reference 
books. 
Instead, organizing a reference book collection in another way is necessary. Enter the Dewey 
Decimal system. This system of organizing reference books by subject matter has helped 
increase research efficiency, while also helping libraries around the world have one consistent 
system. This way, you can find what you need, no matter what library you might use. 
The Dewey Decimal system arranges reference books into these categories: 
  000 General Knowledge. This reference section includes things about general topics, like 
computers or technology, as well as reference books like almanacs and encyclopedias. You 
can also find newspapers in this section, in addition to books on museums or the Internet. 
  100 Psychology and Philosophy. In this section, you will find books on psychology and 
philosophy, including books on ghosts and the supernatural, as well as optical illusions, 
emotions, values, and animal laws. 
  200 Religions and Mythology. When you use the 200 section of the Dewey Decimal system, 
you will find books on the ancient cultures of the world, including books like the Bible, both 
New and Old Testament, as well as books on mythology and world religions. 
  300 Social Sciences and Folklore. In the social sciences section, you will find books on social 
issues, government, careers, court systems, legal trials, military equipment, drugs, 
environmental issues, education, phonics, transportation, holidays, and scary stories. 
  400 Languages and Grammar. If you are looking for books on sign language or 
hieroglyphics, or you are trying to find a dictionary, a book about grammar, or a thesaurus, this 
is the proper section. 
  500 Math and Science. You will find books on science experimentation, math, astronomy, 
physical science, chemistry, volcanoes, weather, dinosaurs, forests, oceans, evolution, plants, 
animals, and insects here. 
  600 Medicine and Technology. Some call this the Applied Science section, and it includes 
inventions, human body, space ships, vehicles, pets, cookbooks, home improvement, careers, 
paper-making, woodworking, building, and more. 
  700 Arts and Recreation. Art, history of art, architecture, paper arts, drawing crafts, knitting, 
sewing, print making, photography, music, sports, magic tricks, etc. 
  800 Literature. Poetry, plays, jokes, and Shakespeare are all in this section. 
  900 Geography and History. American history, explorers, atlases, flags, ancient civilizations, 
Middle Ages, World Wars, European countries, African countries, North and Central 
American countries, Native Americans, South American countries, and Pacific Islands and 
Australia. 
While the computer system at your local library can help you find the books you need, you might 
also want to memorize what each of the Dewey Decimal categories include. This allows you to 
go directly to the section you need and look up and down the aisles until you find the reference 
book that best suits your needs, or simply look at the category to see what other books might 
help answer your question. 
Benefits of the Dewey Decimal System 
Though the Dewey Decimal system has become commonplace for most users of the library, it is 
something that allows you to find the larger category of your research topic. 
Other benefits of this system include the following: 
  broad categories. The Dewey Decimal system has 10 different categories that help give users 
a starting point from which to begin their search. 
  narrow categories. Within the broader categories are smaller categories that will help you 
find the topics you need in order to complete the project you have to complete. 
  ability to find more reference books. When you walk into a library that uses the Dewey 
Decimal system, you will be able to see what the book shelves have in terms of the books you 
want, and then you can look in the same section to find related books more easily. 
  consistent system. The system is consistent and allows you to become more proficient at 
using the library with every visit. 
  efficient research. When you are ready to research just one topic, you can go to one place 
instead of moving all over the library as you might have to do if you were using a system that 
was just assigned by the author's last name. 
 The benefits of the Dewey Decimal system make it obvious why many libraries continue to use 
the system. 
How to Use the Dewey Decimal System 
To use the Dewey Decimal system, you will begin with looking at either the category in the 
system that you need to use, or you might want to go directly to the computer to find a precise 
number for a certain book. As you have already learned about the broad categories, it will be 
more helpful for you to see what the system looks like in terms of the smaller 
categories[1] within the larger categories:

begin research will help you start your research efficiently. 
 
The Library of Congress System:Many libraries are also turning to the Library of Congress 
system of organization. This system is used in larger libraries as well as in academic 
libraries.This system looks like this: 
A Generalities 
B, BF Philosophy, Psychology 
BL – BX Religion 
H Social Sciences 
PA – PG Language 
Q - Science 
T - Technology 
N, M, GV – Arts, Sports 
PQ – PT Literature 
G, E, F – Countries, Travel, History 
If you can find out which system the library uses, this will help you to find the reference books 
you need more easily. NOTE: Different libraries may use different names on the Dewey Decimal 
system. 
 

5. Professional way of using a Dictionary


1
Module 4 
A DICTIONARY 
 
Many people may not think about a dictionary as being a reference book, but it can help you 
begin to understand not only the words you might not know, but also how they can be used in a 
paper, project, or article. 
You can find dictionaries that are in book form, or you can use online dictionaries. 
Some online dictionaries can be found at the following Web sites: 
  Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com 
  Your Dictionary, www.yourdictionary.com 
  Dictionary Reference, dictionary.reference.com 
Other dictionaries to use include: 
  New American Webster Handy College Dictionary, 4th Edition 
  The American Heritage College Dictionary, Fourth Edition 
  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition 
  Webster's New College Dictionary, Third Edition 
  Webster's New World Student's Dictionary 
Many dictionaries are also available via CD-ROM, allowing you to install them directly onto 
your computer and never be without these valuable resources. 
 
What a Dictionary Can Tell You 
A dictionary contains a wide array of information about words and the English language. 
However, you might also want to look to foreign language dictionaries when you have research 
projects for those classes or you need to ascertain the meanings of foreign words. 
A basic dictionary will provide this information: 
  meanings: what the accepted definition of a word is; 
  pronunciations: how the word is supposed to be said aloud; 
  derivations: the etymology of a word, where it was created; 
  usage: noun, verb, adjective, conjunction, etc.; 
  antonyms: words with the opposite meaning; 
  synonyms: words with the same or similar meaning. 
 
How to Use a Dictionary in Your Research 
When you are compiling your research, you will find a dictionary can be helpful in a variety of 
ways. Here are some suggestions: 
  Find the meaning of an unknown word. If you are not sure what a word means, turning to a 
dictionary can be a valuable resource. You can look up the meaning of the word and then 
decide how that word can be used in a sentence. 
  Look up the ways that a word can be used. When you want to know how to use a word in a 
sentence, the dictionary is a valuable tool. By learning whether the word is a verb or a noun, 
you can decide where to place it in a sentence. In addition, you can begin to see what other 
words can be used if you need to use the word or meaning in a different part of a sentence. 


6. Thesaurus


1
Module  5 
A THESAURUS 
 
Like a dictionary, a thesaurus can help you expand the way that you discuss your topic. A 
thesaurus contains groupings of words that are collected in terms of their meaning. 
This is how you can use a thesaurus in your research: 
  Choose a word as a starting point. 
  Like a dictionary, find the word in the alphabetic arrangement. 
  Once you find the word, look at the words that are listed alongside the main word. 
  Choose another word that will work to replace the word that was your starting point. 
You may also find a section in a thesaurus that will allow you to see what words are the direct 
opposite of the word you use as the beginning point. This process works in the same way, so 
follow the above steps, except in the last one, choose a word that works as an antonym to the 
word you started with. 
Using a thesaurus can often be part of using a dictionary, as many online dictionaries will 
include these words at the ends of the definitions. This speeds up the process of finding the right 
word for your needs. 
 
Online Thesauruses 
If you want to find a thesaurus online, there are many options available: 
These online thesauruses are up to date and they can give you a long list of words to use in place 
of the word with which you began. 
Online thesauruses are accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection, and they allow 
you to always have this option available to you when you are online. 
Book Thesauruses 
You might also want to have a paper copy of a thesaurus available at your fingertips. This will 
offer a reference book in case the Internet is not available. 
Some recommended thesauruses include: 
  Roget's Super Thesaurus 
  Webster's New World Thesaurus 
  The Merriam-Webster Thesaurus 
These thesauruses can be borrowed from a library, or they can be purchased from a variety of 
bookstores and online shops. 
The only trick to using book thesauruses is that the information that is available is not updated 
until the next edition is published. 
You may want to make sure your thesaurus is up to date before you begin a new research project. 
How to Use a Thesaurus for Research 
There are a number of ways in which you might use a thesaurus for your research needs. 


7. Bibliographies


1
 
 
Module 6 
BIBLIOGRAPHIES  
 You  can  benefit  from  someone  else's  combing  through sources  on  the  topic  you  plan  to 
research. Often researchers list the sources they used on a "Works Cited" or bibliography page at 
the end of a book, journal, or other printed resources. 
This can be a tremendous asset in terms of helping you know which direction to take. From this 
list, you will learn all about the following: 
  Other books to read. You will find a list of sources that help you begin to choose other books 
that might be a good addition to your pile of resources. 
  Other authors to consider. Even if you are not sure about the books listed in a bibliography, 
you might find certain authors repeated in different lists. Those authors might be people you 
want to consider as you are doing your own research. 
  Other sources of information. You may find there are certain journals or publishers who are 
covering information you need to find in your research. 
 
Instead of seeking out these books and other resources, they are already compiled in

 Book Bibliographies 
Many academic books will have a list of resources and references in the back, along with 
appendices and other notes. You will want to look through all of these notes in the books where 
you found particularly useful information. 
Look for the following: 
  Related books: When you use one book for your research, it can be easy to think that book is 
the right one, but there may be others that cover the same topic in a new way.  In the 
bibliography list, look for books that are related to the one you already have used. 
  Opposing books: Look in this reference list to see what books are opposite to the one you 
read. Having an opposite view can highlight areas you might need to investigate further. 
  Titles listed: Just skimming over the titles can help you see what topics are being covered and 
what you may need to consider as you research. These titles also can provide additional 
keywords for your research needs. 
  Years of publication: In looking at the years of publication, you can see what time 
periods are most relevant to the research you are doing or where that type of research began. 
In some cases, the books cited at the back of a larger book may simply have been influential for 
the author. This can help you better understand the author. 
You can then use these new books in your own bibliography if they end up being books that help 
to inform your research.  
Journal Article Bibliographies 
One of the best ways to find additional resources is to use the bibliography in a journal 
article. Because the person who has written the study has taken time before, during, and after the 
study to research the chosen topic, she or he has gathered some of the most meaningful sources. 
In addition, because these writers have access to a diverse set of resources, they often compile 
lists of books and other journal articles that you may not have been able to find on your own.
