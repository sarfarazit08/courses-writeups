To navigate to a different directory, use the `cd` command followed by the path to your target directory:

```shell
cd C:\Your\Desired\Directory
```

**2.3 Make Directory**

Create a new directory using the `mkdir` command:

```shell
mkdir NewDirectory
```

**2.4 Remove Directory**

Remove an empty directory with the `rmdir` command:

```shell
rmdir DirectoryToDelete
```

**2.5 Rename Files or Directories**

To rename a file or directory, use the `ren` command:

3. ***Scripting***: Widely used for automation, the Command Line allows creating batch scripts using Windows batch scripting.

4. ***Access***: Access via Start menu search for "Command Prompt" or "cmd," with alternative interfaces like PowerShell available.

5. ***File Operations***: Users perform file and directory tasks, including create, delete, copy, move, and navigation (e.g., "cd" and "dir").

6. ***System Management***: Useful for tasks like system info checks, service management, and system configuration.

7. ***Network and Connectivity***: Manages network settings, connectivity checks, and tasks like pinging other devices.

8. ***Security***: Supports security tasks, including password changes and user account management.

9. ***Programming and Development***: Developers use it for coding, version control (e.g., Git), and script execution.

10. ***Customization***: Allows customization through color schemes, font changes, and interface settings.

11. ***Command Line Tools***: Windows provides various command-line tools and utilities accessible through the Command Line interface.
